I am interested in working on an open-source web app using either .NET or javascript. I want to create some sort of tool that can help the community in some way, and making it open source would allow collaborators to join in and make the project better. I think a common repository would be the best way to structure it, but if the team becomes too big then a blessed repository may be better.
